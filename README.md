Term Project for CS 476

2. Course assignment
The department of Mathematical and Computer Sciences currently assign classes to instructors 
manually. With close to 50 instructors and hundreds of courses, this process takes weeks and is 
extremely tedious. We would like a program that automatically assigns classes to instructors based on 
several constraints.
 instructor's teaching history
 instructor's course preference
 instructor's time constraint
 available class rooms
